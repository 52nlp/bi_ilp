Eh	O
,	O
it	O

just	O

Right	O

Well	O
,	O
was	O

it	O

Japan	B-GPE

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

to	O

was	O
originally	O

Uh-huh	O

However	O
,	O
Roh	B-PERSON
Moo	I-PERSON

hyun	I-PERSON
actually	O
met	O
with	O
him	O
ceremonially	O
as	O
a	O

because	O
APEC	B-ORG
held	O
the	O
meeting	O
in	O
South	B-GPE

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

But	O

he	O

of	O
the	O
South	O

Uh-huh	O

What	O
he	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O

contrary	O

Koizumi	B-PERSON

diplomatic	O
purpose	O

he	O
not	O

failed	O

the	O

scandal	O
to	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O

from	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
his	O
heart	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
feel	O
it	O
was	O
even	O
worse	O
than	O
not	O
meeting	O
at	O
all	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O

this	O
only	O
hope	O

He	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
get	O
on	O
good	O

with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
,	O
then	O
it	O
follows	O
naturally	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
good	O
relations	O
with	O
our	O
Asian	O

Well	O

regarding	O
this	O
attitude	O
he	O
has	O
adopted	O

well	O
,	O
two	O
professors	O
,	O
how	O
would	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
's	O
diplomatic	O
thinking	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
because	O
he	O
is	O
still	O
using	O
the	O
pre-Cold	O

diplomatic	O
thinking	O
after	O
the	O
Cold	O

that	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Japan	B-GPE
is	O
the	O
second	O

in	O
the	O

Uh-huh	O

As	O
long	O
as	O
these	O
two	O
countries	O
stand	O
together	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
other	O
countries	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
anything	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
actually	O
a	O
very	O
overbearing	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O

Uh-huh	O

That	O
is	O
to	O

if	O

not	O

on	O

then	O
in	O

the	O

will	O
become	O
even	O
more	O
hard	O

in	O

As	O
for	O
Japan	B-GPE

to	O
the	O

it	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
just	O
recently	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
needless	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
that	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
relations	O
with	O
other	O
countries	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
say	O
,	O
with	O
its	O

this	O

have	O
suffered	O
overall	O

These	O

Japan	B-GPE

even	O
including	O
its	O

the	O
US	B-GPE

In	O

,	O
we	O
,	O
even	O
today	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
noticed	O
a	O

that	O

at	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O
Well	O
,	O
today	O
,	O
actually	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
Japan	B-ORG
's	I-ORG
Defense	I-ORG
Agency	I-ORG
again	O
mentioned	O
to	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
that	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
feel	O
regretful	O
,	O

why	O
?	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
a	O
bit	O
regretful	O

Because	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
two	O

plus	O
-	O
two	O
intermediate	O
report	O
just	O
reached	O
,	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
military	O
bases	O
in	O
Japan	B-GPE
should	O
undergo	O
adjustment	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
met	O
with	O
strong	O
opposition	O
from	O
the	O
general	O
public	O
in	O
Japan	B-GPE
.	O

So	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
hard	O
to	O
implement	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
now	O
the	O
JDA	B-ORG
head	O
came	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
,	O
saying	O
,	O
whether	O
our	O
interests	O
can	O
be	O
taken	O
into	O
consideration	O
again	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
intermediate	O
report	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
between	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
and	O
Japan	B-GPE
,	O
centering	O
upon	O
this	O
intermediate	O
report	O
,	O
actually	O
the	O
deal	O
is	O
again	O
partially	O
completed	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
prime	O
minister	O
like	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
,	O
who	O
blindly	O
follows	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
as	O
the	O
guideline	O
of	O
his	O
diplomacy	O
,	O
was	O
rarely	O
seen	O
even	O
during	O
the	O
Cold	O
War	O
era	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

We	O
know	O
that	O
in	O
1957	O
Japan	B-GPE
had	O
three	O
diplomatic	O
principles	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
take	O
good	O
care	O
of	O
its	O
relations	O
with	O
the	O
Western	O
countries	O
,	O
Asian	O
countries	O
,	O
and	O
the	B-ORG
United	I-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
,	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
is	O
like	O
a	O
stick	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
post	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

It	O
takes	O
three	O
points	O
to	O
support	O
a	O
plane	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
such	O
stuff	O
on	O
the	O
surface	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
some	O
prime	O
ministers	O
before	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
at	O
least	O
would	O
still	O
properly	O
deal	O
with	O
and	O
balance	O
the	O
relations	O
with	O
America	B-GPE
,	O
with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
and	O
Asia	B-LOC
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
with	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
,	O
he	O
only	O
takes	O
good	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
relations	O
with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
.	O

Right	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
he	O
will	O
surely	O
fail	O
to	O
take	O
good	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
relations	O
with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
because	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
not	O
win	O
the	O
trust	O
of	O
your	O
Asian	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
,	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
will	O
not	O
fully	O
respect	O
such	O
a	O
country	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

The	O
US	B-GPE
also	O
wants	O
to	O
go	O
beyond	O
Japan	B-GPE
to	O
keep	O
good	O
relations	O
with	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
South	B-GPE
Korea	I-GPE
,	O
and	O
other	O
Asian	O
countries	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
more	O
he	O
follows	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
,	O
the	O
lower	O
will	O
be	O
his	O
actual	O
status	O
in	O
Asia	B-LOC

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
impossible	O
.	O

Right	O
,	O
his	O
idea	O
was	O
actually	O
criticized	O
and	O
opposed	O
by	O
some	O
politicians	O
even	O
in	O
Japan	B-GPE
.	O

He	O
was	O
strongly	O
criticized	O
and	O
increasingly	O
isolated	O
.	O

Ah	O
.	O

The	O
domestic	O
economy	O
was	O
also	O
affected	O

Many	O
people	O
also	O

the	O

you	O
are	O

Yes	O
.	O

Now	O
many	O
media	O
all	O
issued	O
statements	O
and	O
editorials	O

Therefore	O
,	O
some	O
people	O
also	O
compared	O
this	O
diplomacy	O
of	O
his	O
to	O
a	O
lame	O

Yeah	O

He	O

Could	O

as	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON

Koizumi	B-PERSON
's	O

that	O

when	O

he	O

That	O
is	O
to	O

a	O
political	O
power	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
wants	O
to	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
sentiments	O
of	O
extreme	O
nationalism	O
to	O
move	O
toward	O
and	O
realize	O
this	O
goal	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
,	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
wrong	O
doing	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
if	O
Japan	B-GPE
wants	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
powerful	O
country	O
commanding	O
true	O
respect	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
a	O
defeated	O
country	O
,	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
an	O
aggressor	O
country	O
in	O
World	O
War	O
II	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
they	O
chose	O
a	O
very	O
dangerous	O
road	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
tries	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
decent	O
country	O
by	O
negating	O
its	O
history	O
as	O
an	O
aggressor	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
exactly	O
a	O
road	O
that	O
leads	O
nowhere	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
road	O
he	O
takes	O
will	O
surely	O
isolate	O
Japan	B-GPE
from	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
and	O
will	O
definitely	O
not	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
political	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
he	O
chose	O
the	O
wrong	O
road	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
in	O
addition	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
counting	O
on	O
his	O
luck	O
to	O
a	O
large	O
extent	O
.	O

We	O
can	O
also	O
say	O
that	O
some	O
think	O
tank	O
people	O
around	O
him	O
may	O
have	O
given	O
him	O
the	O
wrong	O
idea	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
he	O
was	O
misled	O
,	O
wow	O
.	O

Ah	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
regarding	O
his	O
visits	O
to	O
Yasukuni	O
Shrine	O
,	O
he	O
simply	O
thinks	O
,	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
keep	O
doing	O
it	O
,	O
keep	O
doing	O
it	O
like	O
this	O
,	O
you	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
South	B-GPE
Korea	I-GPE
,	O
ah	O
,	O
you	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
tired	O
of	O
protesting	O
,	O
grow	O
tired	O
of	O
protesting	O
.	O

Once	O
you	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
get	O
used	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
swallow	O
the	O
bitterness	O
while	O
I	O
keep	O
doing	O
like	O
this	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
exactly	O
the	O
opposite	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
this	O
issue	O
could	O
bring	O
big	O
trouble	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
the	O
seriousness	O
of	O
the	O
issue	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
issue	O
of	O
principle	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
an	O
overall	O
review	O
of	O
the	O
current	O
diplomatic	O
status	O
of	O
Japan	B-GPE
should	O
show	O
two	O
clear	O
roads	O
.	O

Ha	O
,	O
one	O
is	O
to	O
follow	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
blindly	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
its	O
very	O
important	O
diplomatic	O
lines	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
can	O
also	O
see	O
the	O
other	O
one	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
to	O
continue	O
damaging	O
the	O
relations	O
with	O
its	O
close	O
neighbors	O

Well	O
,	O
speaking	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
also	O
figure	O
out	O
that	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON

Koizumi	B-PERSON
persistently	O

a	O
series	O
of	O
five	O
visits	O
there	O
from	O
2001	O
to	O
2005	O

Koizumi	B-PERSON
has	O
been	O
in	O
office	O
for	O
four	O
years	O
,	O
four	O
years	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
during	O
these	O
four	O
years	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
say	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
nothing	O
has	O
been	O
much	O
improved	O
,	O
whether	O
in	O
internal	O
affairs	O
or	O
diplomacy	O
.	O

Originally	O
,	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
,	O
ah	O
,	O
took	O
office	O
because	O
he	O
won	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
support	O
rating	O
as	O
a	O
reformer	O
.	O

Eh	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
he	O
pledged	O
to	O
reform	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
internal	O
political	O
and	O
economic	O
situations	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
current	O
status	O
of	O
internal	O
affairs	O
,	O
his	O
reform	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
result	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
in	O
what	O
was	O
expected	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
diplomatic	O
field	O
,	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
constant	O
friction	O
with	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
right	O
now	O
,	O
another	O
important	O
question	O
is	O
how	O
exactly	O
people	O
in	O
Japan	B-GPE
view	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
's	O
diplomatic	O
or	O
internal	O
policies	O
,	O
Professor	O
Jin	B-PERSON
?	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
say	O
that	O
%pw	O
Japanese	O
people	O
now	O
have	O
finally	O
started	O
to	O
cool	O
down	O
in	O
their	O
attitude	O
toward	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
his	O
methods	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
impulsive	O
actions	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
know	O
that	O
among	O
major	O
Japanese	O
newspapers	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
dominant	O
newspapers	O
expressing	O
popular	O
opinions	O
,	O
ranging	O
from	O
Asahi	B-ORG
Shimbun	I-ORG
to	O
Tokyo	B-ORG
Shimbun	I-ORG
,	O
etc	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
recently	O
,	O
even	O
Yomiuri	B-ORG
Simbun	I-ORG
,	O
which	O
originally	O
expressed	O
support	O
for	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
's	O
right	O
-	O
wing	O
tendencies	O
,	O
has	O
started	O
to	O
change	O
sides	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
their	O
tones	O
might	O
be	O
different	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
consensus	O
of	O
Japanese	O
public	O
opinion	O
is	O
that	O
relations	O
with	O
Asian	O
countries	O
must	O
be	O
improved	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
this	O
has	O
already	O
become	O
the	O
mainstream	O
Japanese	O
public	O
opinion	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
specifically	O
,	O
it	O
means	O
prohibiting	O
visits	O
to	O
Yasukuni	O
Shrine	O
.	O

This	O
has	O
been	O
opposed	O
by	O
the	B-ORG
Liberal	I-ORG
Democratic	I-ORG
Party	I-ORG
and	O
all	O
opposition	O
parties	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
pillar	O
in	O
Japan	B-GPE
that	O
supports	O
the	O
Japanese	O
society	O
is	O
the	O
Japanese	O
business	O
community	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
the	O
heads	O
of	O
several	O
groups	O
in	O
the	O
business	O

for	O

the	B-ORG

and	O
the	B-ORG
Japan	I-ORG

,	O
all	O
had	O
frequent	O
direct	O
meetings	O
with	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
,	O
strongly	O
cautioning	O
him	O
not	O
to	O
visit	O
Yasukuni	O
Shrine	O
,	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
because	O
our	O
economy	O
will	O
suffer	O
if	O
our	O
Japan	B-GPE
can	O
not	O
survive	O
in	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
nowadays	O
,	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
should	O
be	O
utterly	O
isolated	O
not	O
only	O
internationally	O
but	O
also	O
domestically	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
to	O
Japanese	O
people	O
,	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
concerned	O
with	O
is	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
how	O
my	O
economy	O
is	O
developing	O
,	O
how	O
my	O
life	O
will	O
be	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
national	O
interests	O
will	O
be	O
damaged	O

whether	O
my	O
personal	O

will	O
be	O
affected	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
noticed	O
that	O
in	O
response	O
to	O
such	O
questions	O
,	O
some	O
analysts	O
recently	O
noted	O
that	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
diplomacy	O
will	O
pay	O
a	O
heavy	O
price	O
for	O
what	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
doing	O
.	O

As	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O
,	O
Professor	O
Liu	B-PERSON
,	O
you	O
also	O
mentioned	O
earlier	O
that	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
economy	O
,	O
for	O

,	O
the	O
Sino	O
-	O
Japanese	O
trade	O
,	O
has	O
already	O
been	O
affected	O
to	O
some	O
extent	O

Well	O
,	O
have	O
they	O
started	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
price	O
already	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
actually	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
Japan	B-GPE
itself	O
is	O
concerned	O
,	O
it	O
still	O
made	O
some	O
mistakes	O
by	O
itself	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
actually	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
won	O
an	O
overwhelming	O
victory	O
in	O
the	O
general	O
election	O
held	O
on	O
September	O
11	O
this	O
year	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
his	O
power	O
to	O
form	O
the	O
cabinet	O
was	O
further	O
strengthened	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Er	O
,	O
he	O
himself	O
thought	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
probably	O
100	O
%	O
,	O
200	O
%	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
200	O
%	O
correct	O
in	O
what	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
doing	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
in	O
his	O
diplomatic	O
efforts	O
,	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
relations	O
with	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
indeed	O
failed	O
miserably	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
itself	O
also	O
failed	O
to	O
meet	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
own	O
demand	O
for	O
economic	O
development	O
and	O
the	O
trend	O
of	O
strengthening	O
economic	O
and	O
trade	O
relations	O
with	O
foreign	O
countries	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
the	O
eastern	O
Asian	O
region	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
bring	O
about	O
economic	O
cooperation	O
in	O
this	O
region	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
looking	O
at	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
economy	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
it	O
is	O
currently	O
recovering	O
its	O
growth	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
externally	O
,	O
it	O
mainly	O
relies	O
on	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
and	O
Chinese	O
markets	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
Chinese	O
market	O
suffers	O
from	O
economic	O
cool	O
-	O
down	O
as	O
political	O
coldness	O
takes	O
heat	O
off	O
economic	O
development	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
produce	O
a	O
very	O
negative	O
effect	O
on	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
economy	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
effect	O
may	O
not	O
show	O
until	O
probably	O
next	O
year	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
just	O
now	O
Professor	O
Liu	B-PERSON
said	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
political	O
coldness	O
that	O
totally	O
damaged	O
its	O
relations	O
with	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
economy	O
,	O
he	O
has	O
also	O
been	O
unable	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
know	O
,	O
what	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
should	O
be	O
more	O

is	O
his	O
failure	O

That	O
is	O

this	O

of	O
the	O

Japan	B-GPE

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
generally	O
speaking	O
,	O
if	O
it	O

get	O

this	O

well	O
,	O
the	O
chances	O
in	O

are	O
extremely	O
slim	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
among	O
many	O
reasons	O
that	O
blocked	O
Japan	B-GPE
from	O
getting	O
accepted	O
this	O
year	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
one	O
was	O
that	O
its	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
did	O
not	O
cast	O
favorable	O
votes	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
--	O

It	O
failed	O
to	O
gain	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
countries	O
in	O
its	O

Right	O

To	O
become	O
a	O
permanent	O
member	O
of	O
the	B-ORG

,	O
the	O
most	O

thing	O
is	O
to	O
first	O
win	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
your	O

Right	O

Well	O
,	O
right	O
now	O
it	O
is	O
its	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
support	O
it	O

Uh-huh	O

Therefore	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
,	O
right	O
,	O
this	O
Prime	O
Minister	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
who	O
has	O
single	O

ruined	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
dream	O
of	O
becoming	O
a	O
permanent	O
member	O
of	O
the	B-ORG
Security	I-ORG

Uh-huh	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
serious	O
cost	O
.	O

Some	O
analysts	O
also	O
mentioned	O
this	O
point	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
right	O
now	O
,	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
are	O
basically	O
very	O
much	O
disappointed	O
with	O
what	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
has	O
been	O
doing	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
many	O
countries	O
have	O
all	O
abandoned	O
their	O
hopes	O
to	O
further	O
mend	O
their	O
relations	O
with	O
Japan	B-GPE
.	O

In	O
this	O
respect	O
,	O
%pw	O
such	O
a	O
question	O
follows	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
how	O
far	O
could	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
go	O
following	O
his	O
diplomatic	O
policy	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
from	O
what	O
can	O
be	O
seen	O
now	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
actually	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
say	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
cabinet	O
he	O
formed	O
after	O
his	O
victory	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
election	O
for	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
indeed	O
see	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
gathered	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
the	O
statesmen	O
,	O
or	O
politicians	O
who	O
approve	O
visits	O
to	O
Yasukuni	O
Shrine	O
,	O
Uh-huh	O
.	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
cabinet	O
,	O
everyone	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
eh	O

He	O
appointed	O
them	O
as	O
,	O
right	O
,	O
appointed	O
them	O
as	O
defense	O
minister	O
or	O
foreign	O
minister	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
sort	O
of	O
determined	O
on	O
this	O
issue	O
to	O
fight	O
against	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
way	O
,	O
he	O
actually	O
sent	O
out	O
a	O
message	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
no	O
sincerity	O
in	O
improving	O
,	O
during	O
his	O
term	O
,	O
improving	O
the	O
relations	O
with	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
will	O
indeed	O
lead	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
disappointment	O
of	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
furthermore	O
to	O
their	O
caution	O
about	O
whether	O
next	O

the	O
prime	O

,	O
the	O
defense	O
minister	O
,	O
including	O

the	O
foreign	O

would	O
all	O
go	O
pay	O
their	O

at	O
Yasukuni	O

If	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
have	O
produced	O
a	O
very	O
extensive	O
negative	O
impact	O
on	O
its	O
relations	O
with	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
actually	O
,	O
right	O
now	O
even	O
the	O
European	O
and	O
US	B-GPE
media	O
have	O
noted	O
this	O
issue	O

Right	O

We	O
,	O
including	O
US	B-GPE
President	O
Bush	B-PERSON
,	O
who	O
came	O
to	O
Pusan	B-GPE
following	O
his	O

to	O
Japan	B-GPE
this	O
time	O
and	O
then	O
will	O
arrive	O
again	O
in	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
are	O
,	O
in	O

also	O
very	O
concerned	O
with	O
this	O
future	O
development	O
of	O
Sino	O
-	O
Japanese	O
relations	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
because	O
I	O
recently	O
met	O
an	O
American	O
scholar	O
whose	O
first	O
question	O
to	O
me	O
was	O
whether	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
any	O
conflict	O
in	O
the	O
East	B-LOC
China	I-LOC
Sea	I-LOC
region	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
serious	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
has	O
already	O
shown	O
tremendous	O
concern	O
about	O
the	O
chaos	O
to	O
international	O
relations	O
in	O
this	O
region	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
resulted	O
from	O
the	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
cabinet	O
's	O
reckless	O
diplomacy	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
merely	O
an	O
issue	O
of	O
Sino	O
-	O
Japanese	O
relations	O
or	O
Japanese	O
-	O
Korean	O
relations	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
triggered	O
that	O
--	O

Yeah	O
.	O

the	O
nerves	O
of	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
public	O
and	O
scholars	O
have	O
started	O
,	O
started	O
to	O
show	O
concerns	O
over	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
right	O
and	O
wrong	O
in	O
WW	O
II	O
,	O
the	O
moral	O
issue	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
has	O
started	O
to	O
pay	O
attention	O
to	O
this	O
issue	O
.	O

The	O
US	B-GPE
has	O
kept	O
quiet	O
on	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
Yasukuni	O
Shrine	O
because	O
it	O
wants	O
to	O
get	O
along	O
with	O
everyone	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
an	O
onlooker	O
to	O
the	O
fighting	O
among	O
eastern	O
Asian	O
countries	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
can	O
no	O
longer	O
sit	O
quietly	O
any	O
more	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
if	O
things	O
go	O
on	O
like	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
interests	O
in	O
this	O
region	O
are	O
also	O
going	O
to	O
suffer	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
now	O
let	O
's	O
look	O
at	O
this	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
post-Koizumi	O
era	O
.	O

What	O
are	O
his	O
standards	O
for	O
selecting	O
his	O
successor	O
?	O

Is	O
visiting	O
Yasukuni	O
Shrine	O
a	O
criterion	O
?	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
important	O
indexes	O
that	O
I	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
watch	O
for	O
regarding	O
which	O
road	O
exactly	O
Japan	B-GPE
will	O
take	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
selection	O
and	O
formation	O
of	O
his	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
cabinet	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
is	O
making	O
his	O
post-resignation	O
arrangements	O
,	O
ah	O

He	O
has	O
started	O
to	O
get	O

The	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON

Has	O
already	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O

following	O
that	O

for	O

if	O
his	O
successor	O
is	O
indeed	O
Shinzo	B-PERSON
Abe	I-PERSON
,	O
well	O
,	O
what	O
will	O
it	O
mean	O
if	O
Shinzo	B-PERSON
Abe	I-PERSON
takes	O
office	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
actually	O
,	O
I	O
see	O

ah	O
,	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
has	O
dual	O
purposes	O
in	O
arranging	O
this	O
cabinet	O
,	O
ah	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
I	O
now	O
feel	O
that	O
he	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
is	O
somewhat	O
adopting	O
a	O
China	B-GPE
policy	O
that	O
separates	O
politics	O
from	O
economy	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
politics	O
,	O
he	O
will	O
go	O
against	O
you	O

eh	O

mainly	O
on	O
the	O
issues	O
of	O
Yasukuni	O

and	O

but	O
in	O
economic	O
and	O

he	O

Uh-huh	O

we	O

on	O
the	O

If	O

Eh	O

we	O
need	O
to	O
watch	O
for	O

this	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
now	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON

the	O

that	O
he	O
will	O
step	O
down	O
voluntarily	O
in	O
September	O
next	O

Well	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
believe	O
completely	O
100	O
percent	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
about	O
this	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
not	O

whether	O
they	O
will	O
make	O
accommodations	O
to	O
let	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON

if	O

the	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
mainly	O
we	O
will	O
see	O
whether	O
he	O

We	O

So	O

we	O

have	O
to	O

not	O

,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
were	O

But	O
,	O
could	O
you	O
analyze	O
and	O
predict	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
achievements	O
he	O
can	O
make	O
during	O
his	O
trip	O
to	O
Pusan	B-GPE
?	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
actually	O
the	O
greatest	O
achievement	O
for	O
him	O
is	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
see	O
facts	O
.	O

What	O
kind	O
of	O
facts	O
?	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
right	O
and	O
wrong	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
some	O
people	O
say	O
that	O
as	O
China	B-GPE
's	O
economy	O
is	O
growing	O
,	O
Japan	B-GPE
is	O
getting	O
somewhat	O
jealous	O
.	O

Er	O
,	O
as	O
two	O
powers	O
are	O
juxtaposed	O
,	O
the	O
relations	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
countries	O
have	O
become	O
somewhat	O
tense	O
.	O

In	O
reality	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
necessary	O
so	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
China	B-GPE
's	O
economy	O
is	O
growing	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
stronger	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
see	O
the	O
relations	O
between	O
China	B-GPE
and	O
South	B-GPE
Korea	I-GPE
are	O
indeed	O
developing	O
rapidly	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
the	O
current	O
trade	O
between	O
China	B-GPE
and	O
South	B-GPE
Korea	I-GPE
has	O
reached	O
nearly	O
100	O
billion	O
US	O
dollars	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Er	O
,	O
within	O
another	O
period	O
of	O
time	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
by	O
2012	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
20th	O
anniversary	O
,	O
the	O
20th	O
anniversary	O
of	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
diplomatic	O
relations	O
between	O
China	B-GPE
and	O
South	B-GPE
Korea	I-GPE
,	O
200	O
billion	O
US	O
dollars	O
'	O
worth	O
of	O
%pw	O
economic	O
trade	O
can	O
be	O
reached	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
this	O
will	O
have	O
surpassed	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
for	O
Japan	B-GPE
and	O
China	B-GPE
which	O
still	O
failed	O
to	O
reach	O
200	O
billion	O
US	O
dollars	O
at	O
this	O
33rd	O
anniversary	O
of	O
the	O
normalization	O
of	O
their	O
diplomatic	O
relations	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

We	O
can	O
say	O
,	O
the	O
economic	O
development	O
in	O
South	B-GPE
Korea	I-GPE
and	O

words	O
,	O
is	O
developing	O
rapidly	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
South	B-GPE
Korea	I-GPE
has	O
been	O
improving	O
its	O
relations	O
with	O
all	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
with	O
the	O
exception	O
of	O
Japan	B-GPE

Uh-huh	O

China	B-GPE
has	O
also	O
significantly	O
improved	O
its	O
relations	O
with	O
all	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
with	O
the	O
exception	O
of	O
Japan	B-GPE
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
Russia	B-GPE
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

We	O
should	O
say	O
,	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
are	O
very	O
clear	O
about	O
what	O
is	O
right	O
and	O
wrong	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
hearts	O
of	O
people	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
can	O
only	O
prove	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
's	O
stubbornness	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
certain	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
change	O
suddenly	O
and	O
completely	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
this	O
time	O
he	O
could	O
only	O
further	O
expose	O
his	O
poor	O
diplomatic	O
skills	O
and	O
his	O
isolation	O
to	O
the	O
international	O
community	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
his	O
past	O
remarks	O
and	O
deeds	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
determine	O
whether	O
he	O
will	O
suddenly	O
change	O
his	O
diplomatic	O
policy	O
after	O
he	O
returns	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
very	O
little	O
chance	O
in	O
this	O
regard	O
.	O

Er	O
,	O
judging	O
from	O
the	O
situation	O
he	O
is	O
in	O
while	O
participating	O
in	O
the	O
APEC	B-ORG
meeting	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
afraid	O
he	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
suffering	O
from	O
friction	O
with	O
neighboring	O
countries	O
only	O
.	O

Apart	O
from	O
that	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
some	O

he	O

on	O
this	O

with	O
some	O
Latin	O

Yes	O

So	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
mentioned	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
program	O
,	O
during	O
his	O

Koizumi	B-PERSON

not	O

also	O

Uh-huh	O

an	O
extremely	O

that	O

Uh-huh	O

For	O

,	O
previously	O
our	O

were	O
made	O
through	O
some	O
conventional	O
methods	O

but	O
this	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O
mobile	O

In	O

this	O

a	O
method	O
highly	O

in	O
various	O

'	O
development	O
of	O

We	O
usually	O
make	O
it	O
sound	O

e-government	O
is	O
something	O
unattainable	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
talked	O
about	O
e-government	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
only	O
done	O
through	O
the	O
Internet	O

Right	O

It	O
seemed	O
that	O
computers	O

ah	O

and	O
the	O

were	O
an	O
expression	O
of	O
e-government	O

to	O
let	O
people	O
find	O
out	O
information	O

Well	O
,	O
presently	O
in	O

,	O
e-governments	O
in	O
various	O
countries	O
apply	O
this	O
so	O

These	O
are	O

Uh-huh	O

In	O

%pw	O
more	O

and	O

are	O
applied	O
in	O
e-government	O

Hence	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
,	O
a	O
test	O
of	O
e-government	O
because	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
during	O
SARS	O
in	O
2003	O
,	O
people	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
criticized	O
e-government	O
during	O
the	O
spread	O
of	O
SARS	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
e-government	O
%pw	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
put	O
into	O
use	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
short	O
SMS	O
like	O
this	O
can	O
fully	O
create	O
interaction	O
between	O
the	O
government	O
and	O
the	O
public	O
through	O
this	O
e-government	O
form	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

We	O
drive	O
often	O
in	O
Beijing	B-GPE

Yang	B-PERSON

If	O
people	O
were	O
not	O
informed	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
traffic	O
accident	O
through	O
SMS	O
on	O
that	O
day	O
and	O
they	O
continued	O
to	O
head	O
there	O
,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
would	O
happen	O
if	O
people	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O
and	O
the	O
jam	O
did	O
not	O
clear	O
?	O

Yes	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
real	O
paralysis	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
appropriate	O
word	O
to	O
use	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
when	O
SMS	O
was	O
used	O
to	O
announce	O
the	O
news	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
fit	O
the	O
conditions	O
in	O
our	O
China	B-GPE
very	O
well	O
.	O

Why	O
is	O
that	O
so	O
?	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
China	B-GPE
is	O
the	O
country	O
with	O
the	O
highest	O
SMS	O
usage	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
probably	O
not	O
as	O
many	O
chances	O
to	O
use	O
SMS	O
in	O
foreign	O
countries	O
compared	O
with	O
domestically	O
,	O
in	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
ah	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
penetration	O
was	O
quite	O
high	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
by	O
using	O
the	O
most	O
familiar	O
method	O
,	O
most	O
used	O
by	O
everyone	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
prompt	O
and	O
most	O
convenient	O
method	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
announcement	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
many	O
friends	O
around	O
me	O
,	O
around	O
me	O
received	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
that	O
almost	O
everyone	O
received	O
this	O

.	O

Yes	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

The	O
effect	O
was	O
extremely	O
good	O
,	O

So	O
,	O
how	O
exactly	O
did	O
citizens	O
react	O
?	O

Let	O

Quite	O

you	O

are	O

Actually	O

concerning	O
this	O

I	O
think	O
both	O
of	O
you	O
are	O
very	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
traffic	O
in	O
Beijing	B-GPE
.	O

Previously	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
statistic	O
,	O
especially	O
for	O
the	O
ring	O
roads	O
in	O
Beijing	B-GPE
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
have	O
an	O
ordinary	O
fender	O
bender	O
or	O
tailgate	O
accident	O
on	O
a	O
bridge	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
Jingguang	O
Bridge	O
of	O
the	O
Third	O
Ring	O
Road	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
cause	O
the	O
entire	O
Third	O
Ring	O
Road	O
to	O
have	O
bumper	O
-	O
to	O
-	O
bumper	O
traffic	O
jams	O
during	O
these	O
morning	O
and	O
evening	O
peak	O
periods	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
might	O
even	O
impact	O
traffic	O
on	O
the	O
Second	O
Ring	O
Road	O
and	O
Fourth	O
Ring	O
Road	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
accident	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
occurs	O
until	O
the	O
time	O
all	O
traffic	O
is	O
cleared	O
,	O
it	O
probably	O
takes	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
an	O
hour	O
during	O
peak	O
periods	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
imposing	O
temporary	O
traffic	O
restriction	O
measures	O
on	O
a	O
long	O
section	O
of	O
road	O
stretching	O
from	O
Jingguang	O
Bridge	O
to	O
Changhong	O
Bridge	O
from	O
the	O
south	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
Guomao	O
Bridge	O
,	O
blocking	O
the	O
main	O
and	O
side	O
roads	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
the	O
situation	O
would	O
be	O
unthinkable	O
during	O
this	O
peak	O
period	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
of	O
work	O
for	O
everyone	O

Hence	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
before	O
6:30	O
a	O

today	O
,	O
before	O
our	O

we	O
moved	O
the	O

forward	O

and	O
before	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
very	O
worried	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
actually	O
after	O
the	O
entire	O
day	O
today	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
here	O
right	O
after	O
ending	O
the	O

this	O

to	O
continue	O
with	O
the	O

here	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
in	O
Beijing	B-GPE
today	O
people	O
indeed	O
experienced	O
an	O
extremely	O
high	O
volume	O
of	O
traffic	O
flow	O
on	O
the	O
roads	O
surrounding	O
the	O
section	O
under	O
traffic	O

,	O
and	O
indeed	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
big	O
traffic	O
jam	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
affected	O
area	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
large	O
as	O
expected	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
some	O
people	O
made	O
detours	O
once	O
they	O
received	O
the	O
news	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Psychologically	O
,	O
people	O
felt	O
quite	O
relieved	O
.	O

Because	O
I	O
know	O
this	O
situation	O
.	O

Right	O
,	O
like	O
those	O
whom	O
we	O
interviewed	O
just	O
now	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
handle	O
once	O
everyone	O
understood	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
viewers	O
we	O
just	O
interviewed	O
mentioned	O
just	O
now	O
,	O
a	O
citizen	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
out	O
today	O
before	O
the	O
incident	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
drive	O
after	O
I	O
was	O
informed	O
.	O

That	O
person	O
did	O
not	O
even	O
drive	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Actually	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
aspect	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
citizens	O
were	O
really	O
quite	O
cooperative	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
this	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
,	O
received	O
an	O
SMS	O
.	O

A	O
friend	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
12th	O
floor	O
of	O
the	O
China	O
World	O
Trade	O
Center	O
at	O
the	O
Guomao	O
Bridge	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
discussing	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
go	O
home	O
in	O
fewer	O
cars	O
since	O
everyone	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
route	O
.	O

Later	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
suggested	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
you	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
take	O
the	O
subway	O
,	O
because	O
you	O
can	O
directly	O
reach	O
the	O
subway	O
once	O
you	O
get	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
China	O
World	O
Trade	O
Center	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Hey	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
this	O
was	O
quite	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O
.	O

Actually	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
everyone	O
was	O
quite	O
cooperative	O
and	O
also	O
quite	O
supportive	O
in	O
this	O
aspect	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
many	O
viewers	O
,	O
viewers	O
not	O
in	O
Beijing	B-GPE
may	O
not	O
be	O
quite	O
familiar	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
with	O
this	O
road	O
section	O
we	O
just	O
mentioned	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
accident	O
occurred	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
take	O
a	O
look	O
later	O
through	O
an	O
animation	O
.	O

This	O
road	O
represents	O
a	O
main	O
road	O
on	O
East	O
Third	O
Ring	O
Road	O
,	O
with	O
problems	O
on	O
both	O
the	O
main	O
and	O
side	O
roads	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
Chaoyang	O
Road	O
is	O
an	O
intersection	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O

Whether	O
it	O
is	O
Chaoyang	O
Road	O
in	O
the	O
east	O
-	O
west	O
direction	O
or	O
the	O
main	O
and	O
side	O
roads	O
of	O
East	O
Third	O
Ring	O
Road	O
in	O
the	O
south	O

north	O
direction	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
from	O
this	O
diagram	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
area	O
at	O
the	O
main	O
and	O
side	O
roads	O
of	O
East	O
Third	O
Ring	O
Road	O
normally	O
has	O
quite	O
heavy	O
traffic	O
,	O
especially	O
during	O
commuting	O
times	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Chaoyang	O
Road	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
artery	O
in	O
the	O
east	O
-	O
west	O
direction	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

When	O
people	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
west	O
want	O
to	O
cross	O
over	O
from	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
via	O
this	O
road	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
if	O
a	O
traffic	O
accident	O
occurs	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
indeed	O
imagine	O
,	O
ha	O
,	O
how	O
widespread	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
impact	O
will	O
be	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
cars	O
caught	O
in	O
traffic	O
jams	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
actually	O
I	O
think	O
everyone	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
buses	O
that	O
cross	O
Jingguang	O
Bridge	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

As	O
buses	O
that	O
cross	O
the	O
Third	O
Ring	O
Road	O
are	O
currently	O
,	O
right	O
now	O
affected	O
by	O
the	O
Jingguang	O
Bridge	O
accident	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
latest	O
results	O
this	O
morning	O
show	O
that	O
32	O
bus	O
routes	O
throughout	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
rerouted	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
perhaps	O
many	O
friends	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
are	O
wondering	O
how	O
one	O
place	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
accommodate	O
32	O
commuter	O
routes	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
accident	O
did	O
not	O
happen	O
,	O
perhaps	O
everyone	O
would	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
this	O
place	O
could	O
normally	O
have	O
so	O
many	O
--	O

It	O
is	O
really	O
like	O
this	O
,	O
just	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
bus	O

.	O

Right	O
.	O

Have	O
not	O
seen	O
so	O
many	O
buses	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Its	O
effect	O
on	O
people	O
has	O
been	O
extremely	O
extensive	O

Yes	O

Uh-huh	O

Actually	O

this	O

some	O

about	O
it	O
via	O

Many	O

their	O

--	O
Since	O
we	O
know	O
that	O
Jingguang	O
Bridge	O
is	O
located	O
in	O
the	O
CBD	B-GPE
district	O
,	O
well	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
office	O

ah	O

a	O

as	O

a	O

who	O
get	O
up	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
to	O
go	O
to	O

Therefore	O
,	O
they	O
sent	O

,	O
hey	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
unusual	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
be	O

Well	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
unusual	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
enjoy	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
morning	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
reminded	O
everyone	O
to	O
wear	O
extra	O

This	O
shows	O
that	O
when	O
people	O
encounter	O
such	O
kind	O
of	O
emergency	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
started	O
to	O
be	O

it	O
with	O
a	O
very	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
mentality	O
in	O
facing	O
emergencies	O
,	O
in	O
one	O

shows	O
a	O
great	O
change	O
of	O
mentality	O
that	O
Beijing	B-GPE
citizens	O
now	O
have	O
after	O
enduring	O
several	O
tests	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
calmness	O

maturity	O
after	O
having	O
experienced	O
frustrations	O

On	O
the	O

I	O

it	O
can	O
also	O
fully	O
show	O
the	O
level	O

Yes	O

This	O

It	O

when	O

Yes	O

I	O

this	O

the	O

an	O

that	O

among	O

How	O

will	O
be	O

?	O

Many	O
groups	O

Yes	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
because	O
social	O
management	O
requires	O
division	O
of	O
labor	O
in	O
society	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
necessarily	O
a	O
labor	O
division	O
trend	O
that	O
involves	O
many	O

and	O
in	O

a	O

Uh-huh	O

How	O
can	O
cooperation	O
be	O
formed	O
between	O

in	O
this	O

of	O
situation	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
sometimes	O
under	O
normal	O
circumstances	O
,	O
sometimes	O
,	O
we	O
often	O
feel	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
difficult	O
for	O
departments	O
to	O
cooperate	O
with	O
one	O

For	O

there	O
are	O

ah	O

too	O
many	O
administrative	O

and	O
very	O
often	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
they	O
are	O

this	O

a	O

at	O
the	O

in	O

the	O

I	O

it	O

many	O
overseas	O

have	O
had	O
such	O
kind	O
of	O

a	O

how	O

at	O

at	O
that	O

at	O
that	O

there	O
was	O
none	O

this	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
clear	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
congested	O

You	O
sat	O
inside	O
the	O

and	O
only	O
knew	O
about	O
the	O
heavy	O

You	O
could	O
find	O
out	O
other	O

only	O
by	O

The	O
various	O

were	O
extremely	O
unclear	O

Well	O
,	O
later	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
experienced	O
that	O
rainfall	O
in	O
Beijing	O
,	O
that	O
rainfall	O
two	O
years	O
ago	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
some	O
days	O
of	O
sand	O

,	O
all	O
channels	O
and	O
early	O
warning	O

were	O
activated	O
in	O
quite	O
an	O
orderly	O
manner	O
.	O

From	O
our	O
perspective	O
as	O
media	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
precisely	O
by	O
going	O
through	O
those	O
breaking	O
-	O
in	O
,	O
trials	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
be	O
so	O
calm	O
in	O
handling	O
such	O
an	O
emergency	O
today	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
everyone	O
the	O
most	O
effective	O
announcements	O
and	O
notifications	O
,	O
and	O
instructions	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
local	O
media	O
in	O
this	O
city	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
become	O
a	O
proactive	O
participant	O
when	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
public	O
emergency	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

It	O
should	O
play	O
its	O
individual	O
role	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
resolving	O
emergencies	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
apart	O
from	O
this	O
,	O
Professor	O
Zhou	B-PERSON
,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
are	O
the	O
areas	O
for	O
improvement	O
for	O
a	O
city	O
,	O
especially	O
a	O
booming	O
city	O
,	O
when	O
handling	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
public	O
emergency	O
?	O

Right	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
gave	O
us	O
many	O
revelations	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
one	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
especially	O
important	O
is	O
early	O
warnings	O
and	O
forecasts	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
currently	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
frequently	O
various	O
kinds	O
of	O
risks	O
lurking	O
in	O
cities	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Early	O
warnings	O
and	O
forecasts	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
mechanism	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
this	O
,	O
this	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
this	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
sudden	O
road	O
cave	O
-	O
in	O
,	O
it	O
also	O
includes	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
security	O
incidents	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
society	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
natural	O
disasters	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
including	O
public	O
health	O
incidents	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
scientific	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
mechanism	O
must	O
be	O
set	O
up	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
manage	O
and	O
resolve	O
an	O
abnormal	O
situation	O
by	O
turning	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
normal	O
situation	O
,	O
without	O
evolving	O
into	O
a	O
sudden	O
public	O
emergency	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Another	O
thing	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
besides	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
emergency	O
response	O
and	O
speedy	O
integration	O
mechanisms	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
some	O
corresponding	O
improvements	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
release	O
of	O
information	O
,	O
incident	O
investigation	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
relevant	O
post-incident	O
responsibility	O
,	O
responsibility	O
system	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
already	O
has	O
quite	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
relevant	O
systems	O
in	O
this	O
respect	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
an	O
administrative	O
investigation	O
system	O
for	O
incidents	O
of	O
major	O
responsibility	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
regulations	O
on	O
investigation	O
procedures	O
for	O
very	O
major	O
incidents	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
others	O
such	O
as	O
emergency	O
response	O
methods	O
for	O
handling	O
public	O
health	O
incidents	O
and	O
public	O
health	O
emergencies	O
,	O
among	O
others	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
many	O
corresponding	O
systems	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
question	O
is	O
how	O
city	O
management	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
handles	O
these	O
various	O
kinds	O
of	O
perhaps	O
unpredictable	O
cases	O
.	O

Since	O
we	O
are	O
entering	O
new	O
circumstances	O
of	O
human	O
living	O
,	O
circumstances	O
that	O
contain	O
high	O
risk	O
and	O
have	O
an	O
increasingly	O
developed	O
urbanized	O
life	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
corresponding	O
improvements	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
systems	O
that	O
includes	O
scientific	O
planning	O
,	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
,	O
emergency	O
response	O
,	O
accident	O
investigation	O
,	O
and	O
accountability	O
.	O

Um	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
understanding	O
of	O
the	O
situation	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
an	O
international	O
perspective	O
,	O
what	O
are	O
some	O
better	O
ways	O
of	O
urban	O
management	O
that	O
are	O
worthwhile	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
learn	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
,	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
China	B-GPE
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
urbanization	O
in	O
foreign	O
countries	O
developed	O
earlier	O
and	O
is	O
more	O
widespread	O
.	O

Their	O
level	O
of	O
development	O
is	O
more	O
advanced	O
than	O
ours	O
.	O

Although	O
the	O
scale	O
of	O
our	O
urbanization	O
is	O
currently	O
expanding	O
at	O
a	O
rate	O
of	O
1	O
%	O
per	O
year	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
economic	O
development	O
being	O
relatively	O
backward	O
,	O
we	O
actually	O
still	O
have	O
many	O
aspects	O
of	O
urban	O
management	O
to	O
learn	O
from	O
foreign	O
countries	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
pipes	O
involved	O
in	O
this	O
incident	O
were	O
basic	O
infrastructure	O

With	O
a	O
background	O
of	O

,	O
how	O
can	O
the	O

strengthen	O

?	O

How	O
can	O
a	O
safe	O
,	O

system	O
be	O
established	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
need	O
to	O

and	O
manage	O
this	O

Uh-huh	O

For	O

,	O
regarding	O

,	O
well	O
,	O
our	O
speed	O
of	O

this	O

was	O
very	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
still	O
have	O
a	O

of	O
work	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
making	O
the	O

that	O
is	O

to	O
really	O
implement	O
a	O
system	O
of	O
levels	O
of	O
responsibility	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
need	O
to	O
explore	O
how	O

between	O

under	O

how	O

with	O
one	O

under	O
these	O

for	O
some	O
of	O

ah	O
,	O
how	O
will	O
these	O
emergency	O

withstand	O
these	O

?	O

We	O

that	O
currently	O

along	O

have	O
set	O
up	O
emergency	O

,	O
but	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
have	O
not	O

Well	O

how	O

These	O

some	O

So	O

with	O
the	O

of	O

and	O
with	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
of	O
such	O
complicated	O

,	O
ah	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
increasingly	O
high	O

That	O
is	O

How	O

The	B-ORG

I	O

finally	O

turn	O
our	O

to	O

basically	O
under	O

Well	O

following	O
this	O

have	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
on	O
this	O

where	O
the	O

occurred	O
,	O
including	O
for	O

Well	O
,	O
Yang	B-PERSON
Yang	I-PERSON
,	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
understanding	O
,	O
how	O
long	O
will	O
it	O
take	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
time	O
really	O
depends	O
on	O
how	O
the	O
overall	O
repair	O
goes	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
exploration	O
,	O
assessment	O
,	O
and	O
repair	O
are	O
carried	O
out	O
in	O
succession	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
regarding	O
this	O
work	O
progress	O
,	O
to	O
repair	O
this	O
road	O
section	O
in	O
the	O
shortest	O
time	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
this	O
will	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
work	O
progress	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
repair	O
is	O
probably	O
not	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
repairing	O
the	O
road	O
surface	O
alone	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
also	O
an	O
issue	O
with	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
pipes	O
below	O

Yes	O
,	O
the	O
pipes	O
below	O
.	O

Right	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
winter	O
,	O
we	O
know	O
that	O
carrying	O
out	O
construction	O
during	O
winter	O
,	O
especially	O
that	O
which	O
requires	O
pouring	O
concrete	O
and	O
then	O
--	O

Moreover	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
especially	O
difficult	O
for	O
concrete	O
to	O
set	O
during	O
winter	O

Yes	O
,	O
preparation	O

But	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
it	O
requires	O
time	O

Hence	O
,	O
it	O
depends	O
very	O
much	O
on	O
factors	O

temperature	O

Just	O
now	O
,	O
you	O

which	O

Uh-huh	O

As	O
we	O
know	O

Putin	B-GPE
has	O
kept	O
putting	O
off	O
this	O
visit	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
since	O
last	O
year	O
,	O

back	O
then	O
when	O
Yeltsin	B-PERSON
repeatedly	O
postponed	O
his	O
trip	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
Japan	B-GPE
asked	O
for	O
too	O
high	O
a	O
price	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
it	O
asked	O
the	O
Russian	O
president	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
to	O
make	O
concessions	O
on	O

Well	O

%pw	O
,	O
well	O

the	O
Russian	O
president	O
was	O
still	O
unwilling	O
,	O
was	O
unwilling	O
to	O
make	O
concessions	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
itinerary	O
was	O
not	O
decided	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

Well	O
,	O
Russia	B-GPE
's	O
attitude	O
was	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
talk	O
about	O
territorial	O
issues	O
if	O
it	O
went	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
Japan	B-GPE
,	O
from	O
the	O
perspective	O
of	O
Japan	B-GPE
,	O
without	O
discussion	O
of	O
territorial	O
issues	O
,	O
the	O
talks	O
were	O
viewed	O
as	O

no	O

For	O
Japanese	O
citizens	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
meaningless	O

Uh-huh	O

It	O
only	O

the	O
lethargic	O
post-APEC	B-ORG

Well	O

what	O
Russia	B-GPE
actually	O
wants	O
is	O
economic	O
cooperation	O
with	O
Japan	B-GPE

Uh-huh	O

Japan	B-GPE
is	O
still	O

this	O

the	O

then	O
we	O
can	O
talk	O
about	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O

based	O
on	O
the	O
outcome	O
this	O

I	O

this	O

remains	O

Uh-huh	O

Er	O
,	O
Director	O
Xing	B-PERSON
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
this	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
very	O
important	O
purposes	O
of	O
President	O
Putin	B-PERSON
's	O

is	O
to	O

the	O

But	O
from	O
what	O
our	O

do	O
you	O

Putin	B-PERSON
has	O

Eh	O

he	O
should	O
be	O

have	O

his	O

Uh-huh	O

The	O
visit	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
was	O
in	O
itself	O
one	O
of	O
Putin	B-PERSON
's	O
important	O

Uh-huh	O

Because	O
with	O
large	O
preconditions	O
having	O
been	O
set	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
the	O
framework	O
having	O
being	O

it	O
is	O
impossible	O
for	O
Putin	B-PERSON
to	O
have	O
further	O

that	O
is	O
to	O

make	O
major	O

on	O
the	O

of	O
Russian	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O

as	O
two	O

between	O
them	O
should	O
be	O

There	O
should	O

which	O

not	O
work	O
if	O
Putin	B-PERSON
refuses	O

So	O

how	O
did	O
he	O

how	O
did	O
he	O
come	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
?	O

As	O
mentioned	O
earlier	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
postponed	O
again	O
and	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
opportunity	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
Putin	B-PERSON
's	O
visit	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
was	O
smoothly	O
accomplished	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

As	O
to	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
result	O
you	O
want	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
another	O
matter	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

But	O
making	O
the	O
trip	O
was	O
significant	O
in	O
itself	O
.	O

What	O
was	O
the	O
significance	O
?	O

It	O
was	O
that	O
Russia	B-GPE
sent	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
message	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
Russia	B-GPE
is	O
willing	O
to	O
develop	O
relations	O
with	O
Japan	B-GPE
.	O

We	O
sincerely	O
have	O
such	O
a	O
wish	O

A	O
wish	O
is	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
achieving	O
results	O

We	O
have	O
such	O
a	O
start	O

Both	O

saved	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
face	O

Right	O
,	O
right	O
,	O
right	O
,	O
in	O

to	O
giving	O

to	O
each	O

Also	O
,	O
on	O
the	O

we	O

it	O
looked	O
fine	O

with	O
12	O

12	O
documents	O
signed	O
as	O
just	O
mentioned	O

They	O
both	O
gave	O

Right	O

It	O
is	O
another	O

if	O
you	O
care	O
about	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
the	O
documents	O

But	O
they	O
were	O

.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
can	O
we	O
interpret	O
it	O
this	O
way	O
?	O

Based	O
on	O
the	O
briefing	O
given	O
by	O
you	O
two	O
experts	O
,	O
both	O
Japanese	O
Prime	O
Minister	O
Junichiro	B-PERSON
Koizumi	I-PERSON
and	O
Russian	O
President	O
Putin	B-PERSON
,	O
they	O
both	O
achieved	O
their	O
own	O
aims	O
in	O
form	O
and	O
got	O
or	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
obtained	O
what	O
they	O
wanted	O
through	O
this	O

On	O
this	O
point	O
,	O
their	O
two	O
fates	O
are	O

Uh-huh	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
both	O
sides	O
have	O
strong	O
nationalist	O
sentiments	O
domestically	O
and	O
powerful	O
parliaments	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
ludicrous	O
for	O
Putin	B-PERSON
to	O
concede	O
on	O
the	O
territorial	O
issues	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
should	O
know	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
entirely	O
impossible	O
,	O
impossible	O
behavior	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
it	O
may	O
also	O
be	O
very	O
difficult	O
for	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
now	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
territorial	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
recently	O
Taro	B-PERSON

that	O

Prime	O

,	O
new	O
Foreign	O

that	O

to	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
the	O
theory	O
of	O
joint	O
development	O
was	O
originally	O
proposed	O
by	O
Russia	B-GPE
.	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
in	O
1996	O
,	O
Primakov	B-PERSON
also	O
proposed	O
it	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
foreign	O
minister	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
been	O
raised	O
prior	O
to	O
that	O
too	O
,	O
but	O
Japan	B-GPE
did	O
not	O
accept	O
it	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
why	O
did	O
Taro	B-PERSON
Aso	I-PERSON
recently	O
again	O
propose	O
such	O
a	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
suggestion	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
checked	O
some	O
data	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Japan	B-GPE
's	O
recent	O
reaction	O
is	O
not	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
mainstream	O
domestic	O
opinion	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
domestic	O
political	O
circles	O
in	O
Japan	B-GPE
all	O
opposed	O
this	O
suggestion	O
by	O
Taro	B-PERSON
Aso	I-PERSON
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
with	O
joint	O
development	O
,	O
Russia	B-GPE
would	O
advocate	O
adopting	O
the	O
current	O
Russian	O
controlled	O
situation	O
,	O
the	O
current	O
situation	O
,	O
and	O
applying	O
Russian	O

Well	O
,	O
by	O
making	O
investments	O
there	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
equivalent	O
to	O
permanent	O

that	O
the	O

are	O
Russia	B-GPE
's	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O
this	O
theory	O
of	O
joint	O
development	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
progress	O
either	O

So	O
under	O
the	O
current	O
situation	O
,	O
the	O
meeting	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
leaders	O
itself	O
was	O
the	O

The	O

did	O
not	O

any	O

Uh-huh	O

responded	O
only	O
with	O
a	O

telegram	O

with	O
no	O

On	O

2004	O
,	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
went	O
by	O

to	O
tour	O
the	O
four	O

This	O
move	O
at	O
once	O
infuriated	O
Russia	B-GPE

Accordingly	O
,	O
the	O
date	O
of	O
Putin	B-PERSON
's	O
visit	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
turned	O
into	O
a	O
variable	O
which	O
nobody	O
could	O
explain	O

In	O
various	O
versions	O
,	O
some	O
said	O

would	O
visit	O
Japan	B-GPE
in	O
April	O
2005	O

some	O
said	O

In	O
Russia	B-GPE
's	O
diplomatic	O
circles	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
even	O
widespread	O
rumors	O

including	O
that	O

would	O
not	O
visit	O

within	O
the	O

and	O
that	O
Russia	B-GPE

would	O
soon	O
be	O

Various	O
speculation	O
existed	O
until	O
May	O
2005	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
celebration	O
of	O
the	O
60th	O
anniversary	O
of	O

Under	O
pressure	O
from	O
various	O
sides	O
,	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
reluctantly	O
attended	O
this	O
celebration	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
precisely	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
Putin	B-PERSON
's	O
visit	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
was	O
basically	O
confirmed	O
.	O

This	O
time	O
,	O
on	O
this	O
visit	O
between	O
Japan	B-GPE
and	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
,	O
er	O
,	O
between	O
Russia	B-GPE
and	O
Japan	B-GPE
,	O
ah	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
Japan	B-GPE
was	O
concerned	O
,	O
it	O
really	O
hoped	O
that	O
Russian	O
President	O
Putin	B-PERSON
would	O
talk	O
about	O
the	O
four	O
northern	O
islands	O
issue	O
during	O
his	O
visit	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
Russia	B-GPE
's	O
thinking	O
was	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
develop	O
the	O
economy	O
first	O
.	O

There	O
should	O
be	O
economic	O
cooperation	O
before	O
we	O
can	O
talk	O
about	O
the	O
four	O
northern	O
islands	O
issue	O
,	O
which	O
means	O
that	O
currently	O
the	O
two	O
sides	O
both	O
insist	O
on	O
a	O
condition	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
the	O
conflict	O
would	O
become	O
more	O
conspicuous	O
during	O
the	O
talks	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
was	O
this	O
also	O
the	O
reason	O
that	O
caused	O
Russian	O

of	O

these	O

again	O
only	O
after	O
these	O
five	O
years	O
,	O
an	O
interval	O
of	O
five	O

?	O

This	O
is	O
already	O

this	O
is	O
not	O
just	O
during	O
Putin	B-PERSON
's	O
tenure	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
like	O
this	O
for	O
the	O
60	O
years	O
after	O
the	O
war	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
separation	O
of	O
politics	O
and	O
economics	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
economic	O
cooperation	O
first	O
or	O
resolution	O
of	O
political	O
issues	O

.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
eased	O
for	O
a	O
period	O
after	O
the	O
Cold	O
War	O
during	O
the	O
Gorbachev	B-PERSON
era	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
Gorbachev	B-PERSON
recognized	O
the	O
four	O
islands	O
issue	O
between	O
Japan	B-GPE
and	O
Russia	B-GPE
.	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O
like	O
this	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
only	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
two	O
islands	O
was	O
recognized	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
once	O
an	O
opportunity	O
for	O
this	O
,	O
but	O
Japan	B-GPE
again	O
did	O
not	O
seize	O
it	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Russia	B-GPE
has	O
changed	O
a	O
lot	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
later	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
after	O
several	O
changes	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
during	O
Hashimoto	B-PERSON
Ryutaro	I-PERSON
's	I-PERSON
term	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
Russia	B-PERSON
proposed	O
separating	O
politics	O
from	O
economics	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
progress	O
on	O
both	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
critical	O
moment	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
territorial	O
issues	O
,	O
perhaps	O
due	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
domestic	O
nationalist	O
sentiments	O
and	O
the	O
sensitivity	O
of	O
the	O
territorial	O
issues	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
any	O
prime	O
minister	O
to	O
claim	O
for	O
two	O
islands	O
only	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

When	O
talks	O
on	O
the	O
two	O
islands	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
final	O
decision	O
,	O
the	O
Japanese	O
prime	O
minister	O
retreated	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
that	O
politics	O
and	O
economics	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
separated	O
and	O
that	O
political	O
issues	O
should	O
still	O
be	O
resolved	O
first	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
addition	O
,	O
the	O
Russian	O
president	O
was	O
exactly	O
the	O
opposite	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
denying	O
at	O
critical	O
moments	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
territorial	O
issues	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
sometimes	O
even	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
islands	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
territories	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
.	O

So	O
,	O
this	O
shows	O
how	O
difficult	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
resolve	O
Japanese	O
-	O
Russian	O
relations	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
in	O
the	O
near	O
future	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
breakthrough	O
progress	O
is	O
also	O
very	O
little	O
,	O
very	O
small	O
.	O

Eh	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
Japan	B-GPE
is	O
the	O
second	O
largest	O
economy	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
Japan	B-GPE
is	O
also	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
investor	O
overseas	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
data	O
shows	O
that	O
Japanese	O
investment	O
in	O
Russia	B-GPE
accounts	O
for	O
only	O
1	O
%	O
of	O
its	O
investments	O
overseas	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
just	O
over	O
700	O
million	O
US	O
dollars	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
as	O
Russia	B-GPE
should	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
badly	O
need	O
Japanese	O
funds	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
badly	O
needing	O
Japanese	O
economic	O
cooperation	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
how	O
urgent	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
Russia	B-GPE
's	O
need	O
is	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
Russia	B-GPE
's	O
most	O
urgent	O
need	O
is	O
already	O
over	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

The	O
most	O
urgent	O
time	O
was	O
still	O
the	O
1990s	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
Russia	B-GPE
was	O
indeed	O
pressing	O
for	O
Japanese	O
investment	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Because	O
Russia	B-GPE
was	O
in	O
a	O
high	O
degree	O
,	O
or	O
deep	O
degree	O
of	O
overall	O
crisis	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
very	O
thirsty	O
man	O
who	O
needs	O
to	O
drink	O
water	O
.	O

At	O
such	O
time	O
,	O
he	O
needs	O
,	O
needs	O
someone	O
else	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
cup	O
of	O
water	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
now	O
,	O
the	O
economic	O
crisis	O
in	O
Russia	B-GPE
is	O
essentially	O
over	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
under	O
such	O
circumstances	O
,	O
Russia	B-GPE
,	O
er	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
make	O
diplomatic	O
arrangements	O
calmly	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
Japan	B-GPE
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
again	O
lost	O
the	O
best	O
opportunity	O
to	O
enter	O
the	O
%pw	O
Russian	O
market	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
lost	O
it	O
forever	O
.	O

In	O
other	O
words	O
,	O
that	O

was	O
the	O
best	O
,	O
a	O
relatively	O
good	O
period	O

Uh-huh	O

Why	O
should	O
we	O
say	O
that	O
?	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
if	O
Japan	B-GPE
had	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
investment	O
in	O
Russia	B-GPE

Japan	B-GPE

in	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
currently	O
Japan	B-GPE

its	O

Uh-huh	O

It	O

this	O

Uh-huh	O

Therefore	O
,	O
just	O
now	O
you	O
mentioned	O
some	O
figures	O

that	O

a	O

Japan	B-GPE
,	O
well	O
,	O
it	O
invested	O
only	O
700-plus	O

in	O
Russia	B-GPE

This	O
is	O
extremely	O

Uh-huh	O

Said	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
ten	O

Well	O
,	O
last	O

's	O
trade	O

perhaps	O
more	O
than	O
9	O

This	O

,	O
%pw	O
,	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
said	O
it	O
may	O
exceed	O
100	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
figure	O
in	O

of	O
trade	O

between	O
two	O

It	O
has	O
nearly	O
reached	O
200	O

between	O
China	B-GPE
and	O
Japan	B-GPE

So	O
.	O

Right	O

Here	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
comparison	O

er	O

between	O
Russia	B-GPE
and	O
Japan	B-GPE
,	O
the	O
trade	O

one	O

Uh-huh	O

Right	O

It	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
one	O

,	O
or	O
one	O

Well	O
,	O
what	O
does	O
this	O
status	O
show	O
?	O

Right	O
,	O
just	O
about	O
,	O
eh	O
.	O

It	O
shows	O
--	O
I	O
will	O
explain	O
two	O
issues	O
--	O
one	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
show	O
that	O
the	O
economic	O
environment	O
in	O
Russia	B-GPE
is	O
indeed	O
not	O
very	O
good	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
general	O
,	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
various	O
countries	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
large	O
nations	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
have	O
entered	O
the	O
Russian	O
market	O
with	O
much	O
ease	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
an	O
objective	O
factor	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
subjective	O
factor	O
too	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
that	O
Japan	B-GPE
does	O
not	O
need	O
the	O
Russian	O
market	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
some	O
non-economic	O
factor	O
is	O
playing	O
a	O
role	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
the	O
territorial	O
issue	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
said	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
nationalist	O
sentiment	O
plays	O
a	O
great	O
role	O
here	O
.	O

So	O
one	O
very	O
important	O
aim	O
of	O
Putin	B-PERSON
's	O
visit	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
also	O
think	O
is	O
very	O
clever	O
,	O
is	O
to	O
put	O
aside	O
some	O
very	O
sensitive	O
old	O
territorial	O
topics	O
.	O

This	O
topic	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
tackle	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
can	O
promote	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
economic	O
relations	O
,	O
as	O
economics	O
is	O
a	O
dynamic	O
factor	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Putin	B-PERSON
came	O
this	O
time	O
bringing	O
more	O
than	O
100	O
people	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
large	O
delegation	O
,	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE

He	O

to	O
solicit	O

,	O
to	O
use	O
our	O

this	O

Right	O

I	O

However	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
this	O

,	O
the	O
form	O
still	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
outdone	O
the	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
Japan	B-GPE
's	O
relations	O
with	O
Russia	B-GPE
,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
like	O
this	O
since	O
the	O
1970s	O
.	O

When	O
Tanaka	B-PERSON
Kakuei	I-PERSON
went	O
there	O
,	O
he	O
also	O
did	O
this	O

I	O
will	O
invest	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
give	O
you	O
aid	O
to	O
develop	O
eastern	O
Siberia	B-LOC

That	O
's	O
because	O
Russia	B-GPE
has	O
a	O
vast	O
area	O
of	O
land	O
.	O

We	O
know	O
the	O
population	O
is	O
small	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
they	O
can	O
not	O
develop	O
it	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
treasure	O
is	O
all	O
hidden	O
underground	O

Well	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
still	O
,	O
they	O
still	O
wanted	O
to	O
solve	O
the	O
population	O
problem	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
Japan	B-GPE
used	O
economics	O
for	O
political	O
purposes	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
now	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
Koizumi	B-PERSON
has	O
still	O
not	O
changed	O
this	O
course	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
way	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O

this	O

In	O

what	O

They	O

some	O

But	O
,	O
with	O

to	O
this	O
Russian	O
issue	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
this	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
simply	O
regarded	O
as	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
people	O
making	O
trouble	O
,	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
widespread	O
historical	O
grievances	O
among	O
ordinary	O
people	O
in	O
Japan	B-GPE
against	O
Russia	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
contact	O
with	O
many	O
Japanese	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
this	O
involves	O
the	O
origin	O
of	O
the	O
Northern	B-LOC
Territories	I-LOC
issue	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
originated	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
ago	O
and	O
involves	O
three	O
major	O
issues	O
.	O

One	O
is	O
that	O
historically	O
and	O
legally	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
changed	O
several	O
times	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
in	O
1855	O
,	O
in	O
1875	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
1905	O
after	O
the	O
Russo	O
-	O
Japanese	O
War	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
WW	O
II	O
,	O
at	O
these	O
critical	O
points	O
,	O
ownership	O
of	O
the	O
territories	O
was	O
constantly	O
changing	O
.	O

With	O
ancestors	O
constantly	O
changing	O
,	O
both	O
sides	O
had	O
their	O
own	O
arguments	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
ownership	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
Northern	I-LOC

has	O
changed	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
no	O

Therefore	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
truth	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Now	O
Russia	B-GPE
says	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
WWII	O
international	O
laws	O
and	O

,	O
with	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
also	O
recognizing	O
it	O
at	O
that	O

Uh-huh	O

The	O
entire	O
international	O
community	O
recognizes	O
that	O
the	O
four	O
islands	O
should	O
belong	O
to	O
Russia	B-GPE

Both	O
the	O
Yalta	O

Japan	B-GPE

relinquishment	O
of	O
the	B-LOC

However	O
,	O
then	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
nationalist	O
sentiment	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
Japan	B-GPE
believes	O
that	O
the	B-GPE
Soviet	I-GPE

For	O

this	O

as	O
Japan	B-GPE
looks	O
at	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O

there	O

these	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
noticed	O
,	O

,	O
just	O
now	O
this	O
short	O

also	O
talked	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
the	B-GPE
Soviet	I-GPE

agreed	O
to	O

two	O

first	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
Japan	B-GPE
never	O
agreed	O

But	O
now	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O
Japanese	O
side	O
again	O
proposed	O
,	O
Taro	B-PERSON

proposed	O
a	O

that	O
the	B-GPE

had	O
previously	O

Well	O
,	O
can	O
this	O

?	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
as	O
joint	O
development	O
and	O
sovereignty	O
of	O
the	O

are	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
two	O
concepts	O

It	O
wo	O
n't	O
work	O
,	O
either	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
eh	O

But	O
this	O
is	O
relevant	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Oh	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
just	O
mentioned	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
against	O
a	O
large	O

that	O
Russia	B-GPE
first	O
proposed	O
it	O

Uh-huh	O

With	O
quite	O
a	O

,	O
quite	O
a	O

Russia	B-GPE
needed	O
Japanese	O

needed	O
Japan	B-GPE
to	O
get	O
involved	O
through	O
this	O
channel	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
now	O
that	O
its	O
economy	O
has	O
greatly	O
improved	O
,	O
Russia	B-GPE
does	O
not	O
need	O
to	O
take	O
this	O

risk	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
one	O

Second	O
,	O
Russia	B-GPE
should	O
be	O
seen	O
as	O
a	O
rather	O
strong	O
nation	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
the	O
four	O

,	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
sensitive	O

for	O
the	O
Russian	O

Any	O
small	O

Russian	O

one	O

Uh-huh	O

Well	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
four	O
northern	O
islands	O
issue	O
is	O
a	O
dead	O
knot	O
in	O
bilateral	O
relations	O
that	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
untied	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
both	O
are	O
working	O
hard	O
,	O
yet	O
with	O
seemingly	O
little	O
hope	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
how	O
can	O
Japanese	O
-	O
Russian	O
relations	O
develop	O
under	O
such	O
circumstances	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
both	O
sides	O
generally	O
know	O
the	O
two	O
sides	O
'	O
levels	O
of	O
political	O
operations	O
,	O
knowing	O
that	O
territorial	O
issues	O
are	O
hard	O
to	O
resolve	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
with	O
this	O
issue	O
having	O
gone	O
on	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
,	O
both	O
sides	O
may	O
have	O
a	O
bottom	O
line	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
they	O
wo	O
n't	O
say	O
we	O
will	O
stay	O
opposed	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
unresolved	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
like	O
this	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
future	O
both	O
sides	O
may	O
become	O
more	O
reasonable	O
on	O
this	O
issue	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
looking	O
farther	O
ahead	O
,	O
normalization	O
of	O
relations	O
will	O
still	O
be	O
gradually	O
developed	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
do	O
n't	O
always	O
get	O
stuck	O
on	O
the	O
territorial	O
issue	O
.	O

But	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
the	O
territorial	O
issue	O
is	O
also	O
quite	O
important	O
and	O
sensitive	O
.	O

So	O
it	O
is	O
unrealistic	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
say	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
breakthrough	O
progress	O
in	O
Japanese	O
-	O
Russian	O
relations	O
and	O
that	O
their	O
economic	O
and	O
trade	O
relations	O
will	O
suddenly	O
achieve	O
100	O
billion	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O
the	O
prospects	O
for	O
Japanese	O
-	O
Russian	O
relations	O
are	O
not	O
too	O
good	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
normal	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
very	O
common	O
,	O
very	O
,	O
relatively	O
bland	O
kind	O
of	O

Uh-huh	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
Russian	O

Japanese	O
relations	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
perspective	O
of	O
Russia	B-GPE

I	O

these	O

The	O

So	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
seeing	O
on	O

was	O
exactly	O
transmitted	O

Well	O

yesterday	O
the	O
two	O
British	O

in	O
the	O
disclosure	O

Well	O
,	O
here	O
is	O
the	O
scene	O
of	O
the	O
two	O

In	O
the	O

,	O
al	B-ORG

also	O
protested	O
several	O
times	O
upon	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
brief	O
introduction	O
of	O
the	O
context	O
of	O
the	O
incident	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
regarding	O
this	O
topic	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
question	O
today	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
clearly	O
whether	O
this	O
incident	O
was	O
real	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

Let	O
's	O
start	O
with	O
this	O
newspaper	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Director	O
Yuan	B-PERSON
,	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
you	O
also	O
once	O
worked	O
in	O
Britain	B-GPE
.	O

Well	O
,	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
newspaper	O
is	O
the	B-ORG
Daily	I-ORG
Mirror	I-ORG
?	O

It	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
circulation	O
,	O
but	O
people	O
still	O
call	O
it	O
a	O
tabloid	O
.	O

So	O
how	O
accurate	O
is	O
the	O
news	O
carried	O
by	O
it	O
?	O

This	O
is	O
true	O
.	O

Its	O
circulation	O
should	O
be	O
considered	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
among	O
British	O
newspapers	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

But	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
interestingly	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
mainstream	O
newspaper	O
,	O
either	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
it	O
is	O
called	O
a	O
tabloid	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
belong	O
to	O
the	O
mainstream	O
in	O
the	O
current	O
British	O
newspaper	O
industry	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
still	O
called	O
a	O
tabloid	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
placed	O
together	O
with	O
other	O
city	O
newspapers	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
newspaper	O
of	O
national	O
circulation	O
with	O
an	O
extremely	O
powerful	O
influence	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Its	O
influence	O
is	O
mainly	O
on	O
ordinary	O
readers	O
,	O
the	O
general	O
public	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
because	O
most	O
British	O
newspapers	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
steady	O
readership	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
different	O
levels	O
of	O
readership	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Right	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
fairly	O
steady	O
readership	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
newspaper	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
various	O
kinds	O
of	O
topics	O
appropriate	O
to	O
all	O
ages	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
,	O
uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
now	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
seriously	O
consider	O
its	O
authenticity	O
or	O
accuracy	O
.	O

Is	O
the	O
news	O
carried	O
by	O
it	O
credible	O
or	O
not	O
?	O

How	O
much	O
is	O
its	O
accuracy	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
is	O
still	O
quite	O
hard	O
to	O
determine	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

because	O
I	O
will	O
mainly	O
speak	O
from	O
two	O
perspectives	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
Mirror	B-ORG
got	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
news	O
,	O
it	O
called	O
10	B-ORG
Downing	I-ORG
Street	I-ORG
the	O
first	O
night	O
,	O
saying	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
such	O
information	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
,	O
uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
it	O
meant	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
whether	O
10	B-ORG
Downing	I-ORG
Street	I-ORG
had	O
anything	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
but	O
Downing	B-ORG
Street	I-ORG
said	O
it	O
had	O
no	O
comments	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
news	O
was	O
released	O
,	O
it	O
set	O
off	O
such	O
a	O
mighty	O
uproar	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
point	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
point	O
is	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
reaction	O
of	O
al	B-ORG
-	I-ORG
Jazeera	I-ORG
TV	I-ORG
station	O
.	O

What	O
al	B-ORG
-	I-ORG
Jazeera	I-ORG
TV	I-ORG
station	O
is	O
now	O
asking	O
Britain	B-GPE
to	O
do	O
is	O
to	O
either	O
confirm	O
the	O
news	O
as	O
true	O
or	O
to	O
deny	O
it	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
,	O
uh-huh	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
right	O
now	O
,	O
Britain	B-GPE
has	O
neither	O
said	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
nor	O
said	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
the	O
situation	O
.	O

It	O
did	O
not	O
confirm	O
anything	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
still	O
one	O
detail	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
introduced	O
the	O
context	O
information	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
mentioned	O
the	O
two	O
staff	O
members	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
leakage	O
of	O
the	O
information	O
.	O

These	O
two	O
staff	O
members	O
,	O
also	O
considered	O
British	O
government	O
employees	O
,	O
have	O
already	O
been	O
under	O
interrogation	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
since	O
they	O
are	O
under	O
interrogation	O
,	O
it	O
means	O
they	O
may	O
have	O
indeed	O
divulged	O
the	O
secret	O
.	O

Could	O
this	O
be	O
used	O
to	O
determine	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
indeed	O
such	O
an	O
incident	O
?	O

There	O
was	O
such	O
an	O
incident	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
uh-huh	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
questions	O
involved	O
in	O
this	O
matter	O
.	O

One	O
is	O
whether	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
secret	O
being	O
divulged	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
is	O
whether	O
the	O
news	O
that	O
Bush	B-PERSON
wanted	O
to	O
bomb	O
al	B-ORG
-	I-ORG
Jazeera	I-ORG
TV	I-ORG
station	O
is	O
true	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
these	O
are	O
two	O
different	O
questions	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Regarding	O
the	O
leakage	O
of	O
the	O
secret	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
the	O
possibility	O
here	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
is	O
really	O
big	O
.	O

What	O
secret	O
exactly	O
was	O
divulged	O
?	O

Um	O
.	O

Because	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
British	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
government	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
its	O
Official	O
Secrets	O
Act	O
Section	O
5	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
illegal	O
for	O
newspapers	O
or	O
media	O
to	O
publicize	O
indiscreetly	O
government	O
information	O
obtained	O
through	O
unauthorized	O
channels	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
these	O
two	O
people	O
have	O
already	O
been	O
suspected	O
of	O
violating	O
this	O
section	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
why	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
sued	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
in	O
a	O
preliminary	O
stage	O
right	O
now	O
,	O
and	O
yesterday	O
a	O
hearing	O
lasting	O
only	O
15	O
minutes	O
was	O
held	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
both	O
of	O
these	O
two	O
people	O
denied	O
they	O
were	O
guilty	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
now	O
it	O
will	O
still	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
a	O
quite	O
lengthy	O
judicial	O
procedure	O
.	O

Eh	O
,	O
in	O
other	O
words	O
,	O
although	O
they	O
were	O
interrogated	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
secret	O
leaked	O
was	O
something	O
like	O
our	O
topic	O
today	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
Bush	B-PERSON
said	O
he	O
wanted	O
to	O
bomb	O
al	B-ORG
-	I-ORG

TV	I-ORG
station	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
secret	O
divulged	O
was	O
this	O
record	O
,	O
these	O
are	O
still	O
two	O
different	O
things	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
closely	O
related	O
to	O
this	O
because	O
this	O
is	O
about	O
the	O
so	O
-	O
called	O
memo	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
should	O
be	O
closely	O
related	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

On	O
April	O
16	O
of	O
last	O
year	O
when	O
Blair	B-PERSON
was	O
visiting	O
the	O
US	B-GPE
,	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
exchange	O
between	O
them	O
.	O

That	O
was	O
how	O
this	O
memo	O
came	O
into	O
being	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
five	O
pages	O
long	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
memo	O
,	O
Bush	B-PERSON
seemed	O
to	O
imply	O
that	O
he	O
probably	O
wanted	O
to	O
bomb	O
this	O
al	B-ORG

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
Blair	B-PERSON
tried	O
his	O
best	O
to	O
persuade	O
him	O
not	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
very	O
authenticity	O
of	O
the	O
incident	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
still	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
British	O
government	O
or	O
US	B-GPE
government	O
.	O

They	O
need	O
to	O
come	O
out	O
for	O

Yeah	O

Well	O

Mr.	O

So	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
look	O
at	O

Do	O

to	O

,	O
eh	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
your	O
judgment	O
,	O
this	O

was	O
possible	O

the	O

has	O
long	O
considered	O
it	O
a	O
thorn	O
in	O

Right	O

So	O
,	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O

or	O
the	O

president	O
had	O
such	O
an	O

you	O

may	O

it	O

Yeah	O

There	O
is	O

Right	O

yes	O

All	O
right	O

regarding	O
whether	O

not	O

according	O
to	O
you	O

there	O

there	O

is	O

from	O

,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
is	O
BBC	B-ORG
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
BBC	B-ORG
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
has	O
quite	O
a	O
big	O
influence	O
on	O
it	O
.	O

Just	O
now	O
Mr.	O
Wu	B-PERSON
mentioned	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
its	O
reporters	O
directly	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
Middle	B-LOC
East	I-LOC

at	O
that	O
time	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
was	O
jointly	O
run	O
by	O
BBC	B-ORG
and	O
Saudi	B-GPE
Arabia	I-GPE
.	O

So	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
foundation	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
actually	O
,	O
this	O
al	B-ORG
-	I-ORG

TV	I-ORG
station	O
has	O
a	O
quite	O
unique	O
structure	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
because	O
the	O
emir	O
of	O
this	O
country	O
is	O
called	O
Hamad	B-PERSON
.	O

He	O
studied	O
in	O
Britain	B-GPE
and	O
therefore	O
had	O
quite	O
a	O
good	O
knowledge	O
of	O
Britain	B-GPE
's	O
BBC	B-ORG
TV	O
station	O
.	O

He	O
also	O
quite	O
admired	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
borrowed	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
BBC	B-ORG
style	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
Britain	B-GPE
's	O
BBC	B-ORG
is	O
a	O
very	O
old	O

group	O
established	O
in	O

Uh-huh	O

Though	O
it	O
is	O

by	O
the	O
government	O
with	O
many	O
of	O
its	O
properties	O
owned	O
by	O
the	O
government	O
,	O
it	O
still	O
follows	O
the	O
guideline	O
of	O
editorial	O
independence	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
the	O
top	O
decision	O

making	O
body	O
of	O
BBC	B-ORG
is	O
called	O
the	O
board	O
of	O

which	O
are	O
composed	O
of	O
twelve	O
members	O
directly	O
appointed	O
by	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O
al	B-ORG

adopted	O
this	O

seven	O

Uh-huh	O

However	O

even	O

can	O
come	O

its	O

Eh	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
essence	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Wu	B-PERSON
,	O
is	O
it	O
really	O
a	O
private	O

or	O
a	O

they	O
themselves	O
claim	O
that	O
it	O

in	O
addition	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
such	O
a	O
large	O
team	O
,	O
especially	O
with	O
high	O
,	O
high	O
salaries	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
wages	O
,	O
and	O
reporters	O
based	O
abroad	O
,	O
so	O
many	O
reporters	O
abroad	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
government	O
had	O
not	O
supported	O
such	O
expenditures	O
,	O
eh	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
for	O
a	O
private	O
TV	O
station	O
to	O
survive	O
.	O

According	O
to	O
your	O
knowledge	O
,	O
how	O
much	O
is	O
its	O
yearly	O
expenditure	O
?	O

It	O
was	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
yearly	O
expenditures	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
7	O
billion	O
US	O
dollars	O
.	O

About	O
7	O
billion	O
US	O
dollars	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
equivalent	O
to	O
more	O
than	O
50	O
billion	O
RMB	O
.	O

We	O
should	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
huge	O
financial	O
expenditure	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Extremely	O
large	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
some	O
people	O
call	O
it	O
gaining	O
voice	O
but	O
losing	O
money	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
relatively	O
small	O
revenues	O
due	O
to	O
few	O
ads	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
tremendous	O
influence	O
.	O

Right	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
not	O
bad	O
in	O
gaining	O
voice	O
as	O
it	O
does	O
achieve	O
some	O
effect	O
.	O

Yeah	O
.	O

Ha	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
speaking	O
of	O
its	O
influence	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
also	O
noticed	O
that	O
er	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
Afghan	O

,	O
er	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
the	O
exclusive	O

right	O
to	O
enter	O
Afghanistan	B-GPE
to	O
conduct	O
independent	O
and	O
exclusive	O

,	O
we	O
could	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
its	O
advantages	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
also	O
presented	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
it	O
as	O
well	O

Well	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
a	O
TV	O

,	O
both	O
opportunity	O
and	O
real	O
strength	O
are	O
actually	O
very	O
important	O

Well	O
,	O
as	O
al	B-ORG

has	O
been	O
able	O
to	O

,	O
what	O

you	O

has	O
it	O

upon	O
so	O
that	O
its	O

can	O
surpass	O
,	O
even	O
surpassed	O
CNN	B-ORG
and	O

during	O
the	O

?	O

The	O
greatest	O
feature	O
of	O
al	B-ORG

station	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
small	O

that	O
competes	O
with	O
large	O
ones	O
and	O
has	O
become	O
well	O
-	O
known	O
through	O
wars	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
it	O
can	O
establish	O
itself	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
first	O
relied	O
on	O
the	O
Afghan	O

,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
Iraq	O

after	O
the	O
9	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
made	O
full	O
use	O
of	O
these	O
two	O
opportunities	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Iraq	O

occurred	O
right	O
in	O
an	O

everyone	O
is	O
very	O
much	O
concerned	O
with	O
what	O
is	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O

So	O
,	O
this	O
provides	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
viewership	O
,	O
making	O
it	O
instantly	O
famous	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O

Besides	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
a	O

of	O
resources	O

including	O
its	O

right	O
in	O

as	O
you	O

just	O
now	O

Uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

In	O

is	O
actually	O
quite	O
unique	O
in	O

For	O

a	O
very	O

in	O

the	O

between	O

Uh-huh	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
Arabs	O
will	O
not	O
invite	O
the	O
Israeli	O

to	O
make	O
a	O

on	O

However	O
,	O
for	O
al	B-ORG

,	O
it	O
could	O
invite	O
Barak	B-PERSON

the	O

at	O
that	O

to	O
deliver	O
a	O

at	O

This	O
was	O
unprecedented	O
in	O
the	O

.	O

Right	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
also	O
gave	O
it	O
a	O
very	O
unique	O
perspective	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
it	O
is	O
successful	O
,	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
simply	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
mainly	O
relies	O
on	O
its	O
own	O
very	O
professional	O
news	O
team	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
talented	O

,	O
eh	O

Yeah	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
it	O
also	O
looks	O
at	O

as	O
they	O
happen	O
from	O
the	O
unique	O
perspective	O
of	O
the	O
Arab	O
region	O
or	O
Arab	O
world	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
favorable	O
opportunities	O
and	O
geographical	O
conditions	O
also	O
helped	O
because	O
people	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
Afghan	O
war	O
and	O
the	O
Taliban	B-ORG
were	O
mostly	O
Arabs	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
from	O
Arab	O
countries	O
.	O

They	O
spoke	O
the	O
Arabic	O
language	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
opportunity	O
.	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
the	O
Iraq	B-GPE
,	O
Iraq	O

,	O
which	O
took	O

in	O

In	O
the	O

,	O
as	O

as	O
I	O
know	O
,	O
among	O

dispatched	O
to	O
Iraq	B-GPE
for	O

,	O
I	O
should	O

the	O
one	O
from	O
Qatar	B-GPE

al	B-ORG
-	I-ORG

was	O
the	O
most	O
powerful	O

Uh-huh	O

It	O
had	O
three	O
reporting	O

at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
one	O
group	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

um	O
,	O

from	O

it	O

in	O
covering	O
the	O

in	O
certain	O

Uh-huh	O

We	O
could	O
say	O
it	O
owed	O
its	O

to	O

it	O
seized	O

up	O

Doctor	O
?	O

There	O
is	O
no	O

that	O
what	O
is	O
going	O
on	O
now	O
is	O
a	O
repercussion	O
of	O
the	O
July	O

Uh	O
,	O
Israel	B-GPE
,	O
obviously	O
,	O
Israel	B-GPE
has	O
never	O
in	O
its	O
history	O
encountered	O
,	O
since	O
it	O
came	O
into	O
existence	O
until	O
today	O
,	O
a	O
resistance	O
like	O
the	O
resistance	O
it	O
met	O
in	O
this	O
war	O
.	O

A	O
slap	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
in	O
return	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
.	O

And	O
to	O
this	O
day	O
,	O
we	O
still	O
hear	O
the	O
repercussions	O
within	O
Israel	B-GPE
.	O

Let	O
me	O
go	O
back	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
creation	O
of	O
Israel	B-GPE
.	O

Israel	B-GPE
and	O
the	O
Arab	O
countries	O
have	O
been	O
close	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
during	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
their	O
existence	O
,	O
about	O
50	O
or	O
60	O
years	O
.	O

And	O
during	O
those	O
years	O
,	O
Israel	B-GPE
waged	O
well	O
coordinated	O
wars	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
victorious	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
unlimited	O
support	O
it	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
superpowers	O
.	O

But	O
what	O
Israel	B-GPE
did	O
not	O
fail	O
to	O
observe	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
societal	O
war	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
wage	O
it	O
and	O
destroy	O
Arab	O
society	O
from	O
the	O
inside	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
the	O
final	O
victory	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Because	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
civilized	O
societies	O
whose	O
age	O
goes	O
back	O
thousands	O
of	O
years	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
Israel	B-GPE
understands	O
this	O
premise	O
and	O
it	O
wants	O
to	O
dismantle	O
societies	O
from	O
the	O
inside	O
.	O

Therefore	O
it	O
resorts	O
to	O
sectarian	O
strife	O
,	O
to	O
religious	O
incitement	O
and	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
racial	O
and	O
ethnic	O
strife	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
.	O

This	O
leads	O
naturally	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
someone	O
in	O
Lebanon	B-GPE
is	O
working	O
for	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
Israeli	O
interests	O
,	O
someone	O

the	O

the	O

The	O
Prime	O

the	B-ORG
Ministerial	I-ORG
Committee	I-ORG

National	I-ORG

uh	O
uh	O
uh	O
a	O
proposal	O
whereby	O
the	O
multinational	O

will	O
pull	O
out	O

some	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

Iraqi	O

can	O
uh	O
maintain	O
the	O

So	O
we	O
believe	O
that	O

are	O
ready	O
to	O
leave	O
some	O
of	O
these	O

we	O
take	O

the	O
the	O

when	O

I	O

several	O

The	O
first	O
answer	O
is	O
we	O
can	O
never	O
assure	O

the	O
people	O

America	B-GPE
that	O
they	O

This	O

we	O
enjoy	O
our	O

uh	O
it	O
is	O
simply	O
impossible	O
to	O
protect	O
every	O
single	O

center	O
every	O
single	O
bus	O
every	O
single	O
train	O
or	O
uh	O
any	O

place	O
where	O

may	O
wish	O

And	O
they	O
adjust	O
their	O
tactics	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
protecting	O
and	O
therefore	O
what	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
uh	O
change	O

uh	O

to	O
attack	O

softer	O

way	O
we	O
minimize	O
the	O

maximize	O
the	O

by	O

we	O

it	O

Is	O
that	O
a	O

sure	O

Clearly	O
there	O
is	O
an	O

That	O
the	O

comes	O
when	O

come	O
together	O

It	O

And	O
so	O
I	O
I	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
uh	O
clear	O
in	O
my	O
understanding	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
moving	O

But	O
I	O
'm	O
also	O
very	O
realistic	O
in	O

that	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

as	O
we	O
move	O
through	O
the	O

the	O

will	O
try	O
to	O
challenge	O
the	O

the	O
Iraqi	O

what	O
I	O

what	O
I	O

I	O
I	O

another	O

when	O

our	O

they	O
were	O

at	O

we	O

any	O

a	O
a	O

we	O
can	O
tell	O

in	O
the	O

what	O

is	O

what	O
I	O
've	O

and	O
one	O
would	O
think	O

because	O
you	O
've	O
got	O
it	O
now	O
narrowed	O
down	O
to	O
four	O

perhaps	O
you	O
could	O
go	O
to	O
four	O

strands	O

and	O
try	O
to	O

no	O
no	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
that	O

Um	O
one	O
thing	O
we	O
always	O
caution	O
people	O
about	O
is	O
the	O
pool	O

missing	O

could	O
be	O

what	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
just	O
look	O
at	O
the	O

we	O

immediately	O
make	O
a	O

um	O

a	O
conclusion	O
that	O
this	O

What	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
have	O
the	O

and	O
when	O
we	O
look	O
at	O
this	O

we	O
've	O

've	O

at	O
his	O

the	O

and	O
what	O
we	O
're	O
able	O
to	O
tell	O
from	O
this	O
individual	O
is	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
--	O
he	O
died	O
in	O
his	O
twenties	O

somewhere	O

five	O

um	O
he	O
sustained	O

we	O

we	O
know	O

what	O
we	O
did	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
in	O
about	O
eight	O

So	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
question	O
is	O
when	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
going	O

is	O
that	O
all	O

what	O

better	O
off	O

within	O
the	O

simply	O

the	O

what	O
we	O

problem	O
is	O
the	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
thing	O
to	O
remember	O
about	O
those	O

by	O
the	O

they	O

both	O

Now	O
the	O
North	O

felt	O

that	O
by	O

a	O
very	O

The	O
Iranians	O
have	O
miscalculated	O

They	O
fou-	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O
could	O

we	O

And	O
we	O
've	O
essentially	O

you	O

Tim	B-PERSON
I	O
think	O
another	O
reason	O
for	O

that	O
there	O
're	O
two	O
issues	O
that	O
are	O
separate	O
from	O
the	O
six	O
party	O
talks	O
that	O
are	O
a	O
serious	O
grievance	O
in	O
our	O
relationship	O
/.	O

one	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
frozen	O
financial	O

the	O
North	O

I	O
believe	O
rightly	O
so	O
/.	O

but	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
separate	O
bilateral	O
issue	O

The	O
second	O
is	O
our	O
objection	O
to	O
dealing	O
with	O
North	O
Koreans	O
'	O
request	O
for	O
a	O
light	O

Which	O
I	O
believe	O
has	O
bogged	O
down	O
the	O
six	O

Which	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
I	O
believe	O
you	O
could	O
have	O
a	O
separate	O
bilateral	O
face	O
to	O
face	O
negotiation	O
with	O

and	O
also	O
continue	O
the	O
efforts	O
with	O
the	O
six	O

because	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
South	O

the	O
Japanese	O
that	O

you	O

cut	O

out	O

I	O

it	O

you	O

you	O

I	O
you	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
wake	O

up	O
call	O
particularly	O
for	O
those	O
Republicans	O
that	O
campaign	O

Ronald	B-PERSON

and	O

Mike	B-PERSON

Uh	O
what	O
the	O
--	O
what	O
the	O
base	O
is	O
saying	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
expect	O
you	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
every	O

be	O
who	O
you	O

And	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
wake	O

up	O

/.	O

And	O
if	O
the	B-ORG
Republican	I-ORG
party	I-ORG
uh	O
grasps	O
that	O
then	O
we	O
will	O
go	O
about	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
reestablishing	O
the	O
line	O
of	O
distinction	O
between	O
Republicans	O
and	O
Democrats	O
particularly	O
on	O
fiscal	O
matters	O
because	O
the	O
Democrats	O
do	O
n't	O
represent	O
change	O
/.	O

They	O
are	O
s-	O
--	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
saying	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
cut	O
taxes	O
and	O
grow	O
out	O
our	O
economy	O
and	O
create	O
jobs	O
/.	O

They	O
're	O
not	O
saying	O
they	O
want	O
a	O
right	O

sized	O
government	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
we	O
check	O
runaway	O
state	O
government	O
spending	O
and	O
put	O
more	O
emphasis	O
on	O
the	O
private	O
sector	O
/.	O

So	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
represent	O
any	O
change	O
but	O
the	O
change	O
of	O
being	O
from	O
the	O
outside	O
to	O
the	O
inside	O
/.	O

And	O
so	O
Republicans	O
that	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
successful	O
next	O

are	O
Republicans	O
that	O
show	O
a	O
real	O

between	O
the	O

getting	O
