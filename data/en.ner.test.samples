Another	O
aspect	O
of	O

that	O

as	O

,	O
direct	O
or	O

those	O

Also	O
,	O
difficulties	O
in	O

between	O

we	O

over	O

would	O
have	O

did	O

that	O
her	O

had	O
been	O
"	O

that	O

had	O
a	O

"	O
and	O
be	O

at	O

every	O

The	O
only	O
solution	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
to	O
have	O
her	O
learn	O
French	O

That	O

if	O

we	O

,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
at	O

comfortable	O
with	O
the	O

we	O

no	O

knew	O

hiring	O
her	O

seemed	O
better	O

could	O

thank	O

bluntly	O

that	O

been	O
critical	O

A	O
second	O
problem	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O

was	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
who	O
would	O
act	O

the	O

Concern	O

prompted	O

that	O

The	O
president	O
said	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
need	O
for	O
an	O

president	O
because	O

I	O
also	O
looked	O
at	O
civic	O

with	O
which	O
the	O
MOFA	B-ORG
has	O
contacts	O
and	O
which	O
are	O
frequently	O
active	O
in	O
the	O
international	O

I	O
discovered	O
that	O
the	B-ORG
World	I-ORG

for	I-ORG
Freedom	I-ORG

Democracy	I-ORG
is	O
a	O
well	O

and	O
attends	O
the	O
Annual	O

every	O

Therefore	O
when	O
Professor	O
Peng	B-PERSON
invited	O
me	O
to	O
attend	O
,	O
I	O
agreed	O
to	O
join	O
the	O
delegation	O
as	O
an	O
advisor	O
to	O
the	O
league	O
.	O
The	O
MOFA	B-ORG
was	O
very	O
excited	O
about	O
my	O
attending	O
the	O
conference	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
a	O
MOFA	B-ORG
official	O
has	O
entered	O
the	O
UN	B-ORG
headquarters	O
building	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
30	O
years	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
took	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
personally	O
get	O
an	O
understanding	O
of	O
how	O
the	O
DPI	O
/	O
NGO	O
Conference	O
works	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
mainstream	O
international	O
thinking	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
collected	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
relevant	O
information	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
conference	O
materials	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
gained	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
from	O
attending	O
.	O
One	O
of	O
the	O
main	O
topics	O
at	O
this	O
year	O
's	O
conference	O
was	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
monitoring	O
how	O
governments	O
put	O
into	O
action	O
their	O
ideals	O
and	O
their	O
promises	O
to	O
their	O
peoples	O
.	O

Another	O
main	O
focus	O
of	O
discussion	O
was	O
the	O
partnership	O
between	O
NGOs	O
,	O
national	O
governments	O
and	O
the	O
UN	B-ORG
itself	O
.	O

These	O
are	O
all	O
very	O
important	O
things	O
for	O
Taiwan	B-GPE
to	O
be	O
thinking	O
about	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
ought	O
to	O
participate	O
more	O
.	O

The	O
UN	B-ORG
itself	O
is	O
an	O
organization	O
of	O
national	O
governments	O
.	O
At	O
present	O
we	O
are	O
excluded	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
change	O
.	O

NGOs	O
represent	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
point	O
of	O
access	O
.	O

Today	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
tremendous	O
number	O
of	O
NGOs	O
.	O
They	O
hold	O
frequent	O
conferences	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
an	O
ever	O
-	O
growing	O
influence	O
on	O
governments	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
months	O
ago	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
Warsaw	B-GPE
to	O
attend	O
the	O
International	O
Forum	O
on	O
Democracy	O
.	O
The	O
forum	O
was	O
attended	O
by	O
foreign	O
ministers	O
from	O
over	O
100	O
countries	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
also	O
an	O
NGO	O
conference	O
.	O
Those	O
attending	O
included	O
the	O
great	O
American	O
entrepreneur	O
George	B-PERSON
Soros	I-PERSON
,	O
who	O
funded	O
the	O
forum	O
,	O
the	O
former	O
US	B-GPE
ambassador	O
to	O
Beijing	B-GPE
,	O
Winston	B-PERSON
Lord	I-PERSON
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
-	O
all	O
high	O
-	O
ranking	O
,	O
highly	O
influential	O
people	O
.	O

In	O
other	O
words	O
,	O
NGOs	O
are	O
very	O
broad	O
church	O
.	O
Retired	O
diplomats	O
,	O
business	O
-	O
people	O
,	O
social	O
campaigners	O
,	O
academics	O
and	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
foundations	O
may	O
be	O
involved	O
in	O
NGOs	O
.	O
NGOs	O
can	O
be	O
more	O
powerful	O
than	O
governments	O
,	O
so	O
governments	O
certainly	O
ca	O
n	O
t	O
afford	O
to	O
ignore	O
them	O

At	O
present	O
,	O
apart	O
from	O
the	B-ORG
World	I-ORG

for	I-ORG
Freedom	I-ORG
and	I-ORG

a	O

in	O

will	O
actively	O

an	O
international	O
profile	O
,	O
and	O
apply	O
to	O

with	O
the	O
UN	B-ORG
.	O

Another	O
way	O
people	O
in	O
Taiwan	B-GPE
can	O
actively	O
participate	O
in	O
international	O
affairs	O
is	O
by	O
encouraging	O

join	O

such	O

so	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
contribute	O

knowledge	O

and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
let	O

We	O
are	O
living	O
in	O
an	O
age	O
of	O
people	O
power	O

and	O
the	O
UN	B-ORG

responding	O
to	O
the	O
trends	O
of	O
our	O
time	O
.	O
In	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
NGOs	O
merely	O
played	O
a	O
monitoring	O
role	O
at	O
the	O

,	O
but	O
now	O
the	O
trend	O
is	O
towards	O
their	O

in	O

Hence	O
in	O
our	O
future	O
approach	O
to	O
the	O
UN	B-ORG
,	O
besides	O
continuing	O
to	O

due	O

snake	O
