Steps (See run.sh)
- CRF-based NER
 * training: build Chinese and English NER models
 * test: predict NER results and probability of each word to a tag
- Calculate PMI
 * calculate PMI scores through the NER results
- Bilingual ILP
 * predict NER results with bilingual ILP
- Evaluation
 * evaluate the performances of CRF-based and Bi_ILP-based NER
